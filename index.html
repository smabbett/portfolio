						<p>As a former flight attendant, I have seen so many beautiful places
              in the world. I've met so many interesting people.
              And, of course, enjoyed many culinary delights!</p>
						<ul>
							<li>I've toured the Palace of Versailles.</li>
							<li>I've skied in the mountains of Niseko, Japan.</li>
							<li>I've biked through the tulip fields of the Netherlands.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>While I've enjoyed my travels, I always come back to my home,
              Eden Prairie, MN.</p>

							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My interest in coding began in middle school with a school
              competition, which I won. For years, I treated web development as
              a hobby. Then, as a member of a recreational ski club, I volunteered
              to update the club's website. Following that success, I decided it
              was time to learn and do more with my passion for coding.</p>
            <p>I'm a software developer who is driven to learn. I'm excited to
              become part of a development team. As a software engineering student
              at Thinkful, I will receive the skills necessary to work as a full
              stack developer.</p>
              <ol>
                <h3 class="reasons">Four reasons why you should hire me:</h3>
                <li>I excel at problem solving through perserverance and a
                  positive attitude towards challenge.</li>
                <li>Through my experiences, I have learned to communicate with
                  people from all walks of life and to demonstrate cultural understanding.</li>
                <li>I am enthusiasitic about creating and building technology
                  through engineering.</li>
                <li>I'm open to learning new technologies throughout my career.</li>
              </ol>
						<p>A change of career is my latest challenge and I can't wait to
              see where I can go!</p>
